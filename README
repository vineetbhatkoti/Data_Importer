This import device program is made using Nodejs, Redis Queue and MongoDB

Design Considerations:
1) Redis Queue was chosen over rabbitMQ due to it being in-memory. In case of importing millions/billions of devices persistence and reliability of the queue should be important. Therefore RabbitMQ would become more favorable.

2) The input file for this utility was tab delimited, but this program can be extended to handle other different type of file format as well like csv or json etc.

3) config.json is the configuration file. New devices and their configurations can be added to it.
